Effective Date: 27-04-2025

B5-art ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use the B5-art app ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number when you use the App.

Photos and Media: The App accesses your device’s photo library to allow you to edit and save photos. These photos are not stored or shared with us. All edited photos remain on your device unless you choose to share them.

Device Information: We may collect non-personal information about your device, including its model, operating system, and unique device identifiers for diagnostic and technical purposes.

2. Target Audience
B5-art is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data or have features that target children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from children under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete that data immediately.

3. Ad Networks
The App may display third-party ads; however, these ads are not targeted to children. If your app targets children, you should ensure that the ads you serve meet Google Play’s Families policy requirements. Learn more about Google’s Families policy here.

4. Security
We take reasonable steps to protect your information. However, no method of data transmission or storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.
